# Graph Representation Project

## Description
This project provides an implementation of different methods to represent graphs in Java. 
Users can choose between an adjacency matrix, a ragged adjacency matrix, or an adjacency list to represent their graph. 
This project is interactive, allowing users to input the vertices and edges.

## Features
- Create and display a graph using a regular adjacency matrix
- Create and display a graph using a ragged adjacency matrix
- Create and display a graph using an adjacency list
- Interactive user input for vertices and edges

## Technologies Used
- Java

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arauzemilio22/GraphRepresentation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd GraphRepresentation
    ```
3. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac src/main/Main.java
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    java src/main/Main
    ```

## Sample Usage
- Follow the prompts to enter the number of vertices and their connections.
- Choose between the three representation methods: adjacency matrix, ragged adjacency matrix, or adjacency list.
